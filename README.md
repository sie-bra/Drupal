# Drupal

As soon as you start developing websites in Drupal 7, the need to create custom modules arises. There will be plenty of situations where you need to create custom hooks to handle certain business requirements for your Drupal website; and those hooks have to live inside a custom module. 

Creating custom modules is handy for when you need to hook into and modify Drupal features or add new functionality without hacking core files or overloading your theme. 

Keep that in mind: <strong>Keep Calm and clear cache!</strong> when you implement hooks. Depending on the hook implemented, this might be necessary.
